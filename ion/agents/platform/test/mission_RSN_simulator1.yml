# This sets up a mission for 2 CTD simulators (SBE37_SIM_01 and SBE37_SIM_02) 
# on LJ01D from the RSN OMS simulator
# SBE37_SIM_01 mission will start at 20:00:00, wait, sample, and idle
# This mission will loop every 30 mins until an operator intervenes
# SBE37_SIM_02 mission will start at 20:00:00, wait, sample, and idle
